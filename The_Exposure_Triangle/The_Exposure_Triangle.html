  <h2>A Beginners Guide to Manual Photography</h2>

  <p1>This webpage is intended to be used as a guide to help the beginning
  photographer understand how a cameras shutter speed, ISO setting and
  apererture work together to create a successful image.
  After reviewing this page you will be able to feel confident taking your
  camera out of AUTO mode and making amazing images using only the manual
  setting on your DSLR by understandig the three components to the Exposure Triangle:
    <ul>
      <li><em>ISO</em>
      <li><em>APERATURE</em>
      <li><em>SHUTTER SPEED</em>
    </ul>

  So lets get started! The creative world of photgraphy
  is waiting for you!</p1>

  <h3>The 3 components to exposure:</h3>
    <p2>When using the word exposure in photography what is it that we are
      really talking about? It's simple really. All photographs are made by
      allowing light to reach your cameras sensor (prior to the onset of digital
      photograpy the sensor would have been replaced with the cameras film.)
      Therefore getting proper exposure, and as a result a successful photograph,
      is a matter of contolling how much light reaches your cameras sensor and
      for how long. So how is this achieved? By using the settings on your camera
      that control ISO, APERATURE & SHUTTER SPEED. Below is basic explanation of
      what each of these settings controls:</p2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ISO:</strong>
          The ISO setting on your camera controls the sensitivity of the
          cameras sensor to light.  ISO settings can range from 100 to as high
          as 51,200 on certain DSLR models. The lower the number the less sensitive
          the sensor is to light and the higer the number the more sensitive.
           Generally speaking it is desirable to use the lowest possible ISO
           setting in order to achieve the clearest photo.

        <li><strong>APERATURE:</strong> The aperature setting on your cameras controls the size
          of the opening in your cameras aperature blades.  Aperature settings vary
          based on the lens that is being used but for this lesson we will
          assume we are using a lens with and aperature range of F3.5 to F22. At
          this point we need to touch on one of the more confusing aspects of
          photography which is the F stop settings.  So without further ado here
          it is the smaller the F Stop setting the larger the opening in your aperature.
          The opposite is also true in that the larger the F stop setting the smaller
          the opening in your aperature.  So, using our assumed lens a setting of F3.5
          would be largest possible opening in the aperature and a setting of F22
          would be the smalles possible opening in the aperature. Confused? Don't worry,
          being confused about aperature settings when first beginning is part
          of the time honored process of learning the fundamentals of photography.

          <P><img src="img/img4.jpg" alt="An image of aperature settings." style=float: left"></P>

        <li><strong>SHUTTER SPEED:</strong> The shutter speed controls..you guessed it! How fast
          or slow you cameras shutter opens and closes thus allowing light to
          pass through the aperature and reach the sensor. As your understanding
          of the exposure triange improves you will be able to use shutter speed
          settings in comination with ISO and APERATURE setting to achieve specific
          creative effect such as blurring the flow of water in a stream to achieve
          a silky smooth appearance of the water or creating a "starburst" effect
          from a streetlight when shooting night photography.

   </ul>
  <p3>Now that we've covered the three main components of the exposure triangle
    lets go over a few examples of how the 3 settings can be used in specific examples
    to achieve proper exposure:</p3>
      <ol>
        <li>EXAMPLE 1: <em>Shooting indoors with low light.</em> In order order to shoot photographs indoors with low light, for example during a dinner party or wedding,
          it would be neccessary to utilize as much of the available light in the room
          while still having a fast enough shutter speed to allow the photogropher to hold the
          camera by hand and freeze the subjects (in this case the people in attendance).  The first
          step in this scenario would be to open up the aperature as wide as possible which would mean (and again
          reffering to our assumed lens from above) setting the F Stop to F3.5.  The second step in this scenario
          would be to increase the cameras sensitivity to light by increasing the ISO setting.  Remember, generally speaking
          it is good photographic practice to keep the ISO setting as low as reasonably possible to keep the photo looking as
          clear as possible.  A good rule of thumb is no higher than 1,600 - anything above this and the photo will begin to look grainy (referred to as noise)
          so for the assumed scenario lets start by settng the ISO at 1,600. So what have we achieved with these 2 settings?  First we have opened the aperature
          up as wide as possible allowing as much of the limited light to reach the cameras sensor while simutaneously increasing the sensors
          sensitivity to light therefore allowing it to utilize the light passing through the aperature as much as possible.
          As a result of these two settings we can now set the third element of the exposure triangle, the shutter speed, to a fast enough setting
          that will allow the photographer to hold the camera by hand and simultaneously freeze the subjects
          without having any blurry photos.  Fantastic right!
        <li>EXAMPLE 2: <em>Shooting outdoors in bright sunlight.</em> Brightly lit skies can often pose one of the most challenging scenarios for photogaphers.
          This is because the extreme amount of light coming from the sun can quickly
          lead to overexposed whitewashed photos.  The first step to avoiding this unwelcome result
          will be limit the cameras sensitivity to light by setting the ISO to its lowest possible
          setting.  In most cases this will be 100.  The second step in this process will be
          to decrease the amount of ligt reaching the sensor by setting the aperature at the highest possible setting.
          Again referring to our assumed lens this would be F22.  So what have we achieved with these two settings? First we
          have decresed the sensors sensitivity to light allowing it to use the excess
          amount of light from the sun without reaching overexposure and secondly we have decreased the
          opening in aperature thereby limiting the amount of light reaching the cameras sensor in the first place.
          With these two settings in place the photographer will be able to choose a shutter speed (on the fast side)that will allow him or her
          to take succesful photographs without getting the overexposred image that
          is so common to shooting in bright sunlight.
      </ol>
  <p4>Hopefully this webpage has brought you a better understanding of how the
    three components of exposure ISO, APERATURE & SHUTTER SPEED work together to
    achieve proper exposure in a digital camera.  Remember, good photography is
    all about practice so get out there with you DSLR and start making photographs!
